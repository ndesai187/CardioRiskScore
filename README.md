# CardioRiskScore
A Ten Year CHD Risk Score study on Framingham Hear Dataset using multiple machine learning techniques

## Goal
As per the World Health Organization report, an estimated 18 million people died from Cardiovascular Disease in 2016. This figure represents 31% of all global deaths. Also, the WHO studies state that cardiovascular diseases can be detected based on other risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, irregular blood pressure etc. One of the leading ongoing research in this area is conducted by “Framingham Heart Study” since 1948.
Framingham dataset contains number of features such as Diabetes, BP Medications, Glucose levels, and age etc. It also has a Ten Year Cardiovascular Heart Disease score (CHD) for selected patients. Our study focuses on a question:
1. Can we successfully predict a patients risk for contracting cardio vascular disease based on their vitals such as Diabetes condition, BP Medications, Glucose levels, and age etc?
